# OpenAI Environment Variable Investigation Report

## Issue Summary
The user reported that the OpenAI key variable is not being read from the correct `.env.local` file.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Environment File Status
- **No `.env.local` file found** in the project root directory
- The `.gitignore` file contains `.env*` which excludes all environment files from version control
- No environment files exist in the workspace at all

### 2. OpenAI Usage Search
- **No OpenAI references found** in the codebase
- Searched for:
  - `openai` (case-insensitive) in `.js`, `.ts`, `.tsx` files
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable references
  - `gpt` references
  - `chat` functionality
  - `ai` references

### 3. Project Context
- This is a Next.js 15.3.3 project called "qrewards-new"
- Uses AWS services (Amplify, DynamoDB, S3, SES, SNS)
- Has Google Maps integration (with `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`)
- Contains business/reward management functionality
- No AI/OpenAI dependencies in `package.json`

### 4. Current Environment Variables
The only environment variable reference found is for Google Maps:
```typescript
// src/components/SignupForm.tsx
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY;
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that:

1. **No `.env.local` file exists** - This file needs to be created
2. **No OpenAI functionality implemented** - The application doesn't currently use OpenAI
3. **Missing OpenAI dependency** - No OpenAI SDK installed

## Recommended Solutions

### If OpenAI integration is planned:

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in project root:
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

2. **Add OpenAI API key** to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install OpenAI SDK**:
   ```bash
   npm install openai
   ```

4. **Example usage** in Next.js API route:
   ```typescript
   // src/app/api/chat/route.ts
   import OpenAI from 'openai';
   
   const openai = new OpenAI({
     apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

### If this was a misunderstanding:

The current project doesn't use OpenAI. If you meant a different API key (like Google Maps), that should be configured as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.

## Next Steps

1. **Clarify the requirement**: Does the project actually need OpenAI integration?
2. **Create `.env.local`** if it doesn't exist
3. **Add the appropriate environment variables**
4. **Restart the development server** after adding environment variables

## File Structure for Environment Variables

For Next.js projects, environment variables should be in:
- `.env.local` - Local development (git-ignored)
- `.env.development` - Development environment
- `.env.production` - Production environment

The project correctly excludes `.env*` files from git in `.gitignore`.
