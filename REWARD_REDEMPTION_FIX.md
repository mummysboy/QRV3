# Reward Redemption Fix - Preventing Multiple Redemptions

## Problem Identified

The reward system had a critical flaw where **redeemed rewards were not properly removed from the database**, allowing the same reward to be redeemed multiple times. This happened because:

1. **Multiple claims allowed**: Users could claim the same reward card multiple times as long as quantity > 0
2. **Individual deletion only**: When redeeming, only the specific claimed reward record was deleted, not preventing other instances
3. **No redemption tracking**: No mechanism to prevent the same card from being redeemed multiple times

## Root Cause Analysis

### Before the Fix:
```
User A claims reward → creates ClaimedReward A
User B claims reward → creates ClaimedReward B  
User A redeems → deletes ClaimedReward A
User B can still redeem → ClaimedReward B still exists
```

### The Issue:
- The `redeem-reward` API was deleting individual `ClaimedReward` records
- But multiple `ClaimedReward` records could exist for the same card
- No validation that the card itself had already been redeemed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Redeem-Reward API (`/api/redeem-reward/route.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Pre-redemption validation**: Check if reward is already redeemed before processing
- **Batch redemption**: Mark ALL claimed rewards for the same card as redeemed
- **No deletion**: Keep records for audit purposes but mark as redeemed

**New Flow:**
```typescript
// Check if already redeemed
if (claimedReward.redeemed_at) {
  return error("This reward has already been redeemed");
}

// Mark current reward as redeemed
updateClaimedReward(id, redeemed_at: new Date())

// Find and mark ALL other unredeemed rewards for same card
const otherRewards = findUnredeemedRewards(cardid, excludeId)
for (const reward of otherRewards) {
  updateClaimedReward(reward.id, redeemed_at: new Date())
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Get-Claimed-Reward API (`/api/get-claimed-reward/route.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Filter by redemption status**: Only return unredeemed rewards
- **Prevent access**: Redeemed rewards are no longer accessible

**New Query:**
```graphql
listClaimedRewards(filter: { 
  and: [
    { cardid: { eq: $cardid } },
    { redeemed_at: { attributeExists: false } }
  ]
})
```

### 3. Enhanced Claim-Reward API (`/api/claim-reward/route.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- **Pre-claim validation**: Check if card already has unredeemed claimed rewards
- **Prevent duplicate claims**: Block claiming if reward is already claimed and pending redemption

**New Validation:**
```typescript
// Check if card already claimed and not redeemed
const existingRewards = findUnredeemedClaimedRewards(cardid)
if (existingRewards.length > 0) {
  return error("This reward has already been claimed and is pending redemption")
}
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### ✅ **Prevents Multiple Redemptions**
- Once a reward is redeemed, it cannot be redeemed again
- All instances of the same reward are marked as redeemed

### ✅ **Maintains Data Integrity**
- No more duplicate redemptions
- Proper audit trail of all redemption attempts

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- Clear error messages when trying to redeem already-redeemed rewards
- Prevents confusion from accessing expired rewards

### ✅ **Audit Compliance**
- All redemption attempts are logged
- Complete history of when rewards were claimed and redeemed

## Testing the Fix

Use the provided test script `test-reward-redemption.js` to verify:

1. **First claim**: Should succeed
2. **First redemption**: Should succeed  
3. **Access redeemed**: Should fail (404)
4. **Second claim**: Should fail (already claimed)
5. **Second redemption**: Should fail (already redeemed)

## Database Schema Impact

**No breaking changes** - the fix works with existing data:
- `ClaimedReward` records now use `redeemed_at` field to track status
- Existing records without `redeemed_at` are treated as unredeemed
- No data migration required

## Deployment Notes

1. **Backup**: Always backup your database before deploying
2. **Test**: Run the test script in development first
3. **Monitor**: Watch logs for any errors during redemption
4. **Rollback**: Keep previous version for quick rollback if needed

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- **Redemption expiration**: Auto-expire unredeemed rewards after X days
- **Business notifications**: Alert businesses when rewards are redeemed
- **Analytics**: Track redemption patterns and success rates
- **Batch operations**: Bulk redeem multiple rewards for efficiency
