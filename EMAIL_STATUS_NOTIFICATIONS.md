# Email Status Notifications System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive email notification system that has been implemented to automatically notify users of account status changes in the QRewards platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Status Change Notifications

The system now sends automatic email notifications for all major status changes:

- **Business Account Approval** - When a business is approved by admin
- **Business Account Rejection** - When a business application is rejected
- **Application Received** - When a business signs up and is pending approval
- **Account Suspension** - When a business account is suspended
- **Profile Update Approval** - When business profile updates are approved
- **Profile Update Rejection** - When business profile updates are rejected
- **Generic Status Changes** - For any other status changes

### 2. Email Templates

Each status change has a professionally designed email template with:

- **Branded Design** - Consistent QRewards branding and styling
- **Clear Messaging** - Status-specific content and next steps
- **Contact Information** - Links to contact form for support
- **Action Buttons** - Relevant CTAs (login, dashboard, contact support)
- **Responsive Design** - Works on all email clients

### 3. Contact Form Integration

All emails include links to the contact form (`https://www.qrewards.net/contact`) for users who have questions about their status changes.
